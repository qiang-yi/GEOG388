##### Class time: Monday&Wednesday 1:30PM to 2:45PM <br/>Classroom: Physical Sciences Building 310 

### Overview
This course is an introduction to geographical information systems, focusing on spatial data processing and analysis in the science and management of environmental and human resources.  Topics covered include GIS data structures, data sources, data collection, data quality, geodesy and map projections, spatial and tabular data analyses, digital elevation data and terrain analyses, cartographic modeling, and cartographic layout.  Laboratory exercises provide practical experiences that complement the theory covered in lectures. The goal of the course is to help students to gain a comprehensive understanding of GIS concepts and get started with using GIS in practice.

The specific learning outcomes are:
* 	Understanding basic spatial data structures and being able to edit the data using GIS.
* 	Being able to use publicly available GIS data for practical analytic work.
* 	Being familiar with the common tools of spatial analysis GIS.
* 	Being able to use GIS as analytic platform to support decision-making.

### Readings and Materials
Suggested textbook (not required):

GIS Fundamentals: A First Textbook on Geographic Information Systems, Fifth edition, Bolstad, Paul V., 2016.

Supplementary readings will be recommended weekly

 
### Course Structure: 
•	30 lectures & labs, including 11 labs.
•	10 regular labs, 1 final lab.
•	2 exams (1 mid-terms, 1 final)
•	Participation and popup quizzes

### Grading:
Grading: Grading will be based on my best professional judgment of our performance on a set of weighted components. The components and weights are:
- 40% - Weekly labs
- 10% - final lab
- 15% - Midterm exam (short answer)
- 25% - Final exam (short answer)
- 10% - Participation

#### Grade scale

|A+ 97.5-100	|B+ 87.5-89.99	|C+ 77.5-79.99	|D+ 60.0-64.49|
|---------------|-------|--------|--------|
|A   92.5-97.49	|B   82.5-87.49	|C   70-77.49	|D   50.0-59.99|
|A-  90-92.49	|B-  80-82.49	|C-  65-69.99	|F   <50|

### Course lab work
Labs will be introduced in class and explanation will be given to accomplish the tasks.  Time will be allotted in class to work on the labs.  If more time is needed, they can be finished after class.  Finished labs should be submitted through Laulima unless instructed otherwise **Labs submitted up to 1 week late are penalized 20%. Labs more than 1 week late are penalized 100%.**

Throughout the labs sessions you will need to save/backup your work.  To do this you will need to purchase a portable USB Flash Drive to use in the lab.  As GIS files can be quite large, you should get a 1GB or larger Flash Drive.   Also try to find a USB 2.0 Flash Drive, it will be faster.  

Please note you may work together on labs, but you each must do every part of each lab, and **turn in entirely your own work**.  That means each of you should perform every step indicated in the lab manual. **Your grade is for individual effort; copied files/maps from other students will be construed as cheating, at a minimum you’ll get zero for the lab, and you may automatically fail the course.**

All labs will be done in computer. We will set up an account for every student in the computer lab. The software to be used is ArcGIS 10, its extensions (such as spatial analyst and 3D analyst) and web mapping tools (e.g. Google Maps/Earth).

Finished lab assignments should be submitted in **Microsoft Word** or **PDF** format through **Laulima**. Lab instructions will contain numbered questions to be answered and very specific deliverables such as maps, tables and graphs.

The final lab is different from previous labs in that you will have an opportunity to use what you have learned to solve a practical problem independently. You identify the problem by yourself, e.g., the identification of areas suitable for a park development. You will need to put together the spatial and tabular data required to solve the problem.
